Welcome! I'm **Daniel West**, a systems and electrical engineer focused on SDR-based radar systems, embedded signal processing, and real-time data acquisition using software-defined radio (SDR) platforms like BladeRF. This site showcases my technical projects, research, and publications.

---

### ðŸ”§ Projects and Research
- **MIMO FMCW Radar System**: Dual BladeRF 2.0 SDR platform, synchronized using GPSDO, supporting fine-delay estimation and angle of arrival (AoA) analysis.
- **MATLAB Signal Processing**: Custom delay fusion algorithm combining cross-correlation and spline interpolation for sub-nanosecond resolution.
- **Embedded Development**: Real-time radar signal control using C/C++ and CLI scripting with BladeRF hardware.

See the [Projects](/portfolio/) page for full details.
