<h2>Video Playlist for EE323 - Electronics II Labs (Spring 2023 through Fall 2024) </h2>

I created the following videos as part of my Graduate Assistantship duties to accompany laboratory experiments for Electronics II (EE323) at the Oregon Institute of Technology. 
The purpose of these videos is to provide tutorials on using LTspice, particularly for performing a variety of electrical measurements. 
Additionally, the videos reinforce concepts related to multistage bipolar junction transistors, differential amplifiers, and MOSFET amplifiers.
